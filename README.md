# Mini Python Applications

## A Collection of Foundational Python Projects

### Project Overview
This repository serves as a portfolio of foundational Python projects, demonstrating essential programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and interactive application development. Each Jupyter Notebook within this collection focuses on a specific programming challenge or concept, providing clear, executable examples.

### Projects Included

This repository contains the following Python projects, each within its respective Jupyter Notebook:

1.  **Mini Project (`Mini_Project (1).ipynb`):**
    * **Description:** [You need to fill this in! What does your "Mini_Project" do? Is it a small game, a utility, a data analysis script? Be specific.]
    * **Key Concepts Demonstrated:** [e.g., User input/output, conditional logic, loops, function definition, data structures like lists/dictionaries.]

2.  **Calculator Adventure Game (`Calculator_adventure_game.ipynb` / `Calculator_adventure_game (1).ipynb`):**
    * **Description:** An interactive text-based adventure game that integrates calculator functionalities into its narrative or puzzles. This project combines logical flow with mathematical operations, offering an engaging user experience.
    * **Key Concepts Demonstrated:** User interaction, game logic, conditional branching, arithmetic operations, basic error handling, function calls.

3.  **Clocking System (`clocking.ipynb`):**
    * **Description:** [You need to fill this in! What is this "clocking" system? Is it a time tracker, a timer, a clock display? How does it work?]
    * **Key Concepts Demonstrated:** [e.g., Date/time manipulation, loops for continuous updates, basic file I/O for saving data, user interface concepts.]

4.  **Calculation History (`calculation history.ipynb`):**
    * **Description:** A utility that demonstrates how to record and display a history of calculations performed. This could be integrated with a calculator or a standalone script.
    * **Key Concepts Demonstrated:** File handling (reading/writing), list manipulation, string formatting, basic data persistence.

### Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries:** [List any specific Python libraries you used, e.g., `datetime`, `math`, `random`. If none beyond standard library, you can omit this or say "Standard Python Library".]

### Getting Started

To explore these projects, you will need Jupyter Notebook installed.

#### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* `pip` (Python package installer).

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/mini-python-applications.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd mini-python-applications
    ```
3.  **Install Jupyter Notebook (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
    Or if you prefer `jupyterlab`:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

#### Running the Notebooks

1.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    (or `jupyter lab` if you installed JupyterLab)
2.  Your web browser will open to the Jupyter interface, displaying the contents of the directory.
3.  Click on any `.ipynb` file (e.g., `Mini_Project (1).ipynb`) to open and run the notebook. You can execute cells individually or run all cells to see the project's output.
